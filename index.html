          <h3><em>Hi! I'm Amelia</em></h3>
          <p>
            I’m a current Junior Software Engineering Major at Cal Poly. I'm
            passionate about full-stack development, and have interests in
            quantum mechanics, mathematics, and making an impact with my work. I
            love a good challenge and I’m driven to create innovative software.
            I’m proficient in a wide range of programming languages/concepts
            with excellent communication and an innate ability to solve problems
            creatively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I'm focusing on expanding my experience within software
            development and I'm on the hunt for new opportunities to learn and
            grow. Outside the classroom I'm learning Quantitative Finance in the
            Cal Poly Quantitative Finance Club, tutoring my peers in a variety
            of STEM coursework, thrifting with the Cal poly Sustainability Club,
            and connecting with others like me who are enthusiastic about
            technology, innovative solutions, and science
